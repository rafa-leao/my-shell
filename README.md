Do you know that feeling when you starts at a new job or just buy a new computer and you have to search how to install each tool you use in your developing process? Frustrating right? Yeah we know, we have the same problem. 

This project is about helping you to install rapidly the tools you really like without searching for blogs or documentations. 

Just run it and use it !


## Usage

Well, it is simiple. We divided the folders thinking on what OS you're using. 

- Clone this repo anywhere in your machine;

- Just go to the folder related to your OS and  find the tool you want to install;

- Found it? Simply execute this file and the magic happens;

## Contribution

Since it's a tiny repo we don't have a CONTRIBUTION file with rules yet .

So if you have a nice a idea, don't be afraid and just open a Pull Request so we can talk about it!

### Disclaimers

- If your OS is not ubuntu but is based on linux, running the files from this directory might work for you;

- If you are concerned about the integrity of what is being installed, you can go to the file and read the first line, we usually let the reference of how we came up with that code; 

- This project is in the very beginning so it's a work in progress, we have a lot to do! We encourage you to help us with new ideas;
